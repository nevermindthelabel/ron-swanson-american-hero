# ron-swanson-american-hero

This Project was created to pull random Ron Swanson quotes from an app hosted on [Heroku](https://ron-swanson-quotes.herokuapp.com/v2/quotes).

The app will pull a quote based off of the length, with a small quote getting a quote that is less than 5 words, a medium quote is 5 to 12 words, and a large qoute is 13+ words. The user must click several times on some passes to get a quote to display within the requested quote size, I had thought to save the quotes in a database intitally and update with the ratings, but the instructions seemed to imply there should always be a call to the api to get the data. Perhaps there was a better way to do that than I came up with.

Obviously, I need to dry up the code quite a bit but I am still quite new with react and find writing code verbosely at first is easier for me.

Thank you!
